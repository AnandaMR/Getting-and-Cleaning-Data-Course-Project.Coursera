# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project (Coursera)
## Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones

### Context

This project is part of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course in the Data Science specialization on Coursera, offered by Johns Hopkins University. The goal is to work with data collected from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone to create a tidy dataset that can be used for future analysis.

### Purpose

The purpose of the project is to obtain a tidy dataset by collecting, cleaning, and preparing a raw dataset.

### Instructors

The course is taught by:
- Jeff Leek, PhD
- Roger D. Peng, PhD
- Brian Caffo, PhD

### Original Data

The original dataset comes from the *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set* at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This data represents activities recorded from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. More information is available at [this link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

### Included Files

This repository contains the following files:

- `run_analysis.R`: Script that processes the data.
- `CodeBook.md`: Explains the variables in the dataset.
- `tidyData.txt`: Tidy dataset generated by the script.
- `README.md`: This file.

### `run_analysis.R` Script

This script performs the following steps:

1. **Merges the training and test sets** to create one dataset.
2. **Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation** for each measurement.
3. **Uses descriptive activity names** to name the activities in the dataset.
4. **Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names**.
5. **Creates a second, independent tidy dataset** with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.

#### Processing Details

- **Data Merging**: The training and test files are combined using `rbind()` to form `alldata`.
- **Column Extraction**: Columns containing `mean()` or `std()` are extracted along with the subject and activity identification columns.
- **Activity Naming**: The `activity_labels.txt` file is used for assigning descriptive activity names.
- **Variable Labeling**: Structured replacements are made based on the `features.txt` file.
- **Final Dataset**: Data is grouped by subject and activity, and the mean for each variable is calculated using `summarize_all()`.

#### Execution

To run the script, use:

```r
source("run_analysis.R")
```

#### Reading the Output File

The output file `tidyData.txt` can be read with the following code:

```r
tidyData <- read.table("tidyData.txt", header = TRUE)
```
